# PIR-Gabriele-CAPASSO-Stress-Based-TO-Morphing-Wing-using-NL-Mechanics
Topology Optimization of a shape morphing wing was investigated, considering the influence of nonlinear mechanics and feasibility constraints. Nonlinearities are related to the elastomeric material chosen. The Volume fraction is the objective function. MMA is used as optimizer whereas a unified aggregation and relaxation method is adopted to reduce the number of constraints. Feasibility is analyzed from the viewpoint of structural resistance and possibility to insert an actuator. Final results show a volume fraction of 0,5164 and a complex cross-linked global structure. A successive study on the effects of constraints, Boundary Conditions, input force intensity and position is presented.
